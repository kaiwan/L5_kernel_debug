README

The kgdb_demo/image folder contains two large binaries:
$ ls -lh image/
total 975M
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kaiwan kaiwan  23M Dec 19 12:56 bzImage
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kaiwan kaiwan 512M Dec 19 12:56 rootfs.img
-rwxrwxr-x 1 kaiwan kaiwan 491M Dec 19 12:56 vmlinux*

The bzImage is within 100 MB and GitHub thus handles it, but the other two,
being very large, cannot be tracked.
To solve this, I've made a Release as GitHub allows releases to have large
(read-only) binaries!

So pl download the large rootfs.img and vmlinux files for this demo from the
release here:
